**Issue Fix:** TypeScript Compilation Error in RealAPIService
**Description:** Fixed TypeScript error in real-api.service.ts where metadata object was being assigned additional properties (api_fallback, fallback_reason, fallback_timestamp) that weren't allowed by the strict TransformedEvent interface.
**Technical Solution:** Extended the metadata interface in TransformedEvent to allow additional properties by adding `[key: string]: any` index signature while preserving strict typing for required properties.
**Files Modified:**
- backend/src/services/real-api.service.ts (enhanced metadata interface)
**Verification:** Backend compilation successful - server starts without TypeScript errors
**Impact:** Resolves TypeScript strict mode issues while maintaining type safety for required metadata properties
**Reason for update:** Backend compilation fix - ensures TypeScript compatibility while allowing flexible metadata properties for API fallback scenarios.
