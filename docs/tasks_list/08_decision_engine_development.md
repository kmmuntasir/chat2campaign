### 6. Decision Engine Development

#### [CTOC-0030][BE] Develop Core Decision Engine (Signal Aggregation)
- **Description:** Build the central logic responsible for aggregating event signals from selected data sources, leveraging Groq AI for enhanced processing.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - The engine receives events from multiple configured data sources.
    - It can combine and process these events into a unified view, utilizing Groq AI's capabilities.
    - **Unit Tests:** Test signal aggregation logic with various input combinations, ensuring Groq AI integration functions as expected.
- **Dependencies:**
    - [CTOC-0023][BE] Create `/api/start` Endpoint (Initiation)
    - [CTOC-0033][BE] Implement Local JSON/Generator for Mocked Events
    - [CTOC-0034][BE] Implement Configurable API Endpoints for Fetching
- **Subtasks:**
    - None

#### [CTOC-0031][BE] Implement Logic to Generate Structured JSON Payloads
- **Description:** Develop the part of the decision engine that constructs the final JSON recommendation payloads based on aggregated signals.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Generated JSON payloads strictly adhere to the defined `JSON Output Schema`.
    - Payloads include `audience`, `reasoning`, `channel_plan`, and `campaign_meta` fields.
    - **Unit Tests:** Test payload generation with mock aggregated data to ensure schema compliance.
- **Dependencies:**
    - [CTOC-0030][BE] Develop Core Decision Engine (Signal Aggregation)
    - [CTOC-0036][BE] Ensure Decision Engine Generates Schema-Compliant JSON
- **Subtasks:**
    - None

#### [CTOC-0032][BE] Implement Configurable Rules to Prioritize Channels and Messages
- **Description:** Add a rule-based system within the decision engine to prioritize channels and tailor messages.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Rules can be defined (e.g., in a configuration file) to influence `channel_plan` and `payload`.
    - Rules can prioritize channels based on audience, signal strength, etc.
    - **Unit Tests:** Test various rule configurations and their impact on generated `channel_plan`.
- **Dependencies:** [CTOC-0031][BE] Implement Logic to Generate Structured JSON Payloads
- **Subtasks:**
    - None
