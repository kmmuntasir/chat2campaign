As a user, I want to interact with a chat-style UI that displays streaming campaign recommendations in JSON format.
As a user, I want to select up to 3 data sources from a list (e.g., Website, Shopify, Facebook Page) so that I can focus on specific data for my campaign simulation.
As a user, I want to select up to 4 channels from a list (e.g., Email, SMS, Push) so that I can see campaign recommendations tailored to my chosen communication methods.
As a user, I want to start and stop campaign simulations to control the flow of real-time recommendations.
As a user, I want to toggle between mocked and real API endpoints for each data source so that I can test the system with either simulated or live data.
As a user, I want to configure API URLs and authentication tokens for real API endpoints.
As a user, I want to see streaming JSON payloads displayed in real-time within the chat interface.
As a user, I want to view JSON blocks as collapsible and formatted for easy readability.
As a developer, I want a modular and scalable system so that I can easily add or remove data sources and channels.
As a developer, I want an extendable decision engine so that I can easily modify or integrate new rules and AI models.
As a user, I want the system to gracefully fallback to mocked data if a real API is unavailable, ensuring continuous simulation.
As a user, I want to be able to set up and run the application with minimal steps (e.g., `npm install && npm run dev`).
As a user, I want clear instructions in the README file to understand how to use and configure the application.
As a user, I want to select 3 data sources and 4 channels, so that I can see campaign recommendations.
As a user, I want to toggle between mocked and real API endpoints, so I can test locally or with real data.
As a developer, I want a modular decision engine, so I can easily extend rules or integrate AI.
